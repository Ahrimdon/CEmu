CEmu is a third-party TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculator emulator, focused on developer features.  
The core is programmed in C and the GUI in C++ with Qt, for performance and portability reasons. CEmu works natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Here are some screenshots showcasing some of the features:

## Features
### _Standard features_
* Built-in ROM dump wizard. CEmu does _not_ rely on downloading an OS from TI's website nor does it have a custom boot/loader: a ROM from your own calculator is required. CEmu makes it very easy to get it.
* Accurate and fast emulation (you can also customize the speed and even toggle throttling)
* Resizable calculator screen
* "Always-on-top" window option
* Screen capture (PNG, GIF)
* Screen recording (animated GIF)
* File sending/receiving _(partial, WIP)_
* Multiple keybinding presets
* CE skins (colors like the real devices)

### _Developer features_
* Custom display refresh rate
* Custom emulation speed/throttling
* Code stepping, jumping...
* R/W/X breakpoints
* eZ80 disassembler (with equates support)
* Profiler (WIP-branch)
* Port monitor/editor
* Timers simple monitor/editor
* Memory viewer/editor
* CPU state/registers viewer/editor
* LCD state/parameters viewer/editor
* Memory visualizer (as fully customizable virtual LCDs)
* Stack viewer
* OP1-6 viewer
* VAT viewer
* Variable list with preview and program launcher
* Misc. emulation (backlight, battery...)
* "Autotester" (automated unit testing, light scripting)

## Downloads
No binaries have been released yet as the code keeps changing these days! When available, they'll be here: https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/releases   
The latest Windows builds are available though; [64 bit here](http://jacobly.com/CEmu/master/latest/CEmu64.exe) and [32 bit here](http://jacobly.com/CEmu/master/latest/CEmu32.exe).
_Note that Release builds have an update checking feature, which is disabled in development builds._

If you wish to browse around older builds; Windows binaries are available [here](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/org/github/alberthdev/cemu/git/) or [here](https://jacobly.com/CEmu/) (credits to alberthro and jacobly).

## How to build
After downloading the source (you can clone the repo or just [get the zip](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/archive/master.zip)):

1. Get the [latest Qt5 SDK](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-3) for your OS.  
If you're on Ubuntu, you may need to force update your PATH to have Qt's `bin/` folder prepended. (You might need to run this command, too: `sudo apt-get install git qt5-default`)

2. Now you have two options:
  * In a shell, `cd` to the project's `/gui/qt/` folder and type `qmake -r CEmu.pro && make`
  * Open the .pro file with Qt Creator, set it up (default project settings should be fine), and hit Build. *(Note: you can tell make to use -j4 in the project settings)*

3. If you are using linux, use `sudo make install` to integrate with your desktop.

_Note: Debugging support is somewhat core-related but is only built when `DEBUG_SUPPORT` is defined. The Qt GUI does this in the .pro file._  
_Note 2: If you encounter a build error with something like `lto-wrapper failed`, try removing the -flto option in the .pro file and rebuild (`qmake` etc.). We're not quite sure why this is happening._

You're welcome to [report any bugs](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/issues) you may encounter, and if you want to help, tell us, or send patches / pull requests!

If you'd like to contribute code, please consider using [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) with the settings specified in the `.astylerc` file to format your code. Qt Creator can [format code with Artistic Style](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-beautifier.html) with minimal setup.  
We also welcome more translations (for now, it's available in English, French, and Spanish). Qt Linguist is a great tool for that (here's [a tutorial](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-manager.html)).
